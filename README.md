My RISC-V CPU and Compiler optimized for it (developing)

Simple cpus with maybe only static brach predict or no forwarding unit.

But with a compiler which can reconstruct the code and do favour to the features the cpu has, they may cowork to make a '1 + 1 > 2 + 2', which means a simple cpu and a compiler optimized for it may be better than a complicated cpu and a powerful compiler with no optimization for it.

I want to try this in this repo.
